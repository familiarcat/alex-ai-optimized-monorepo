      "dialogue": "Gentlemen, we have a critical situation. Our 4-phase implementation has created a dependency crisis. We've built comprehensive pages that depend on UI components that don't exist in our system. This is exactly the kind of systematic failure that requires immediate crew coordination. We need to identify all missing components and create them systematically. Make it so!",

      "gestures": "Points to the error-filled viewport with determination"
    },
    "commander_riker": {
      "dialogue": "Captain, I can see the pattern immediately. We have 13+ missing UI components that our new pages are trying to import. This is a classic case of building features before ensuring the foundation is solid. I recommend we create a comprehensive UI component library first, then systematically test each page. I can coordinate the tactical response.",

      "dialogue": "Fascinating, Captain. The error pattern reveals a systematic gap in our component architecture. I can analyze the import statements across all files to identify exactly which components are missing and their required interfaces. This data will be crucial for creating a complete, consistent UI library. I can also identify any other potential missing dependencies.",
      "tone": "Analytical, methodical, data-driven",

      "dialogue": "Captain, this is an infrastructure problem. We need to build a proper UI component system that can scale. I can create a modular component library with proper TypeScript interfaces, consistent styling, and reusable patterns. This will prevent this issue from happening again and make future development much more efficient.",

      "dialogue": "Captain, this is a security and quality issue. We cannot have a system that fails completely due to missing dependencies. I will ensure that all components are properly validated, tested, and secured. We need robust error handling and fallback mechanisms to prevent total system failure.",
      "tone": "Security-focused, protective, quality-oriented",

      "dialogue": "I sense the frustration this is causing, Captain. The user experience is completely broken, and this affects our credibility. We need to not only fix the technical issues but also ensure that our component library provides an excellent user experience. I'll focus on making the components intuitive and accessible.",
      "tone": "Empathetic, user-focused, caring",
      "body_language": "Leans forward with concern, hands resting on the table",
      "commitment": "I'll ensure all components provide excellent user experience and accessibility"
    },
    "lieutenant_uhura": {
      "dialogue": "Captain, this is a communication breakdown between our development systems. The import paths are correct, but the components don't exist. I can ensure that all components are properly exported and that the communication between modules is seamless. This is about ensuring our systems can talk to each other properly.",

      "dialogue": "Captain, this is a systemic health issue. The application is completely non-functional, which is unacceptable for our users. I need to monitor the health of our component system and ensure that we have proper diagnostics and recovery mechanisms. We can't have total system failure like this.",
      "tone": "Health-focused, diagnostic, recovery-oriented",

      "dialogue": "Captain, while you're all discussing the technical aspects, I'm thinking about the business impact. A completely broken application means zero revenue and damaged reputation. We need to fix this quickly and efficiently. I can help prioritize which components to build first based on business value and user impact.",
