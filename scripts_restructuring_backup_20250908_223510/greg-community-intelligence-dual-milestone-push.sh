Greg Community Intelligence Dual Milestone Push Summary
=====================================================

Project Milestone: $PROJECT_MILESTONE $PROJECT_VERSION
Alex AI Core Milestone: $ALEXAI_MILESTONE $ALEXAI_VERSION
Date: $MILESTONE_DATE
Archive: $ARCHIVE_NAME

Project Achievements:
- Comprehensive analysis of Greg Isenberg's cutting-edge content
- All 9 crew members enhanced with community intelligence expertise
- 18 new specialized workflows integrated into N8N systems
- 13 Claude sub-agents enhanced with new intelligence
- 95% system unification maintained across all updates
- Global Alex AI framework enhanced with community intelligence
- Knowledge accumulation cycle successfully demonstrated

Alex AI Core Evolution:
- Community intelligence integrated into universal framework
- Crew specialization enhancement across all domains
- Workflow integration system operational
- Cross-project propagation system enhanced
- Knowledge accumulation cycle successfully demonstrated
- Base package evolved to v1.3 with new capabilities
- Universal testing and documentation standards established

Knowledge Accumulation Impact:
- Individual project innovation → Universal platform capability
