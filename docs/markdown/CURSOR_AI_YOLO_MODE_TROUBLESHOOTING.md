# üîß Cursor AI YOLO Mode Troubleshooting Guide

## üö® **Issue Identified**

YOLO Mode is not working as expected - you're still seeing confirmation prompts despite enabling it.

## üîç **Possible Causes & Solutions**

### 1. **Wrong YOLO Mode Setting**
**Problem**: You might have enabled "Geminicodeassist: Agent Yolo Mode" instead of Cursor AI's native YOLO Mode.

**Solution**: Look for these specific settings:
- `Cursor Settings` ‚Üí `Features` ‚Üí `Chat & Composer`
- Look for "Enable YOLO mode" or "Agent YOLO Mode"
- Make sure it's the **Cursor AI** setting, not a third-party extension

### 2. **Agent Mode Not Enabled**
**Problem**: YOLO Mode requires Agent Mode to be active.

**Solution**:
1. Open the **Composer** panel (usually on the right side)
2. Look for **"Agent Mode"** toggle
3. Make sure **Agent Mode is ON**
4. Then enable YOLO Mode

### 3. **YOLO Prompt Field Has Text**
**Problem**: Some users report that having text in the YOLO prompt field prevents it from working.

**Solution**:
1. Go to YOLO Mode settings
2. **Clear any text** in the YOLO prompt field
3. Leave it **completely empty**
4. Save settings

### 4. **Allowlist/Denylist Configuration**
**Problem**: Commands might not be in the allowlist.

**Solution**:
1. Go to YOLO Mode settings
2. Check the **Allowlist** - add commands you want auto-executed:
   - `git add`
   - `git commit`
   - `git push`
   - `python3`
   - `npm install`
   - `npm run`
3. Check the **Denylist** - remove any commands you want to allow

### 5. **Cursor AI Version Issue**
**Problem**: Older versions might not have YOLO Mode or have bugs.

**Solution**:
1. Check your Cursor AI version
2. Update to the **latest version**
3. Restart Cursor AI after updating

## üéØ **Step-by-Step Troubleshooting**

### Step 1: Verify Agent Mode
1. Open **Composer** panel
2. Look for **"Agent Mode"** toggle
3. **Enable Agent Mode** if it's off
4. Try creating a file to test

### Step 2: Check YOLO Mode Settings
1. Go to **Settings** (`Cmd+,` on Mac)
2. Search for **"YOLO"** or **"Agent"**
3. Look for **Cursor AI** settings (not third-party extensions)
4. Enable **"YOLO Mode"** or **"Agent YOLO Mode"**

### Step 3: Clear YOLO Prompt Field
1. In YOLO Mode settings
2. Find the **"YOLO Prompt"** field
3. **Delete all text** - leave it empty
4. Save settings

### Step 4: Configure Allowlist
1. In YOLO Mode settings
2. Add these commands to **Allowlist**:
   ```
   git add
   git commit
   git push
   python3
   npm install
   npm run
   chmod
   mkdir
   touch
   echo
   ```
3. Save settings

### Step 5: Test YOLO Mode
1. Ask Cursor AI to create a simple file
2. It should create the file **without asking for confirmation**
3. If it still asks, try the next solution

## üîÑ **Alternative Solutions**

### Option 1: Use Keyboard Shortcuts
If YOLO Mode still doesn't work:
- **Accept**: `‚åò‚Æê` (Command + Enter)
- **Reject**: `‚åòX` (Command + X)

### Option 2: Batch Operations
- Group multiple file operations together
- Cursor AI might handle batches differently

### Option 3: Check Cursor AI Documentation
- Visit: https://docs.cursor.com
- Look for latest YOLO Mode documentation
- Check for known issues and workarounds

## üÜò **If Nothing Works**

### Contact Cursor AI Support
1. Go to Cursor AI settings
2. Look for **"Help"** or **"Support"**
3. Report the issue with:
   - Your Cursor AI version
   - Operating system
   - Steps you've tried
   - Screenshots of settings

### Community Forums
- Visit: https://forum.cursor.com
- Search for "YOLO mode not working"
- Post your issue if not found

## üéØ **Quick Test**

Try this simple test:
1. Ask Cursor AI: "Create a file called test.txt with the text 'Hello World'"
2. If YOLO Mode is working, it should create the file immediately
3. If it asks for confirmation, YOLO Mode is not working
