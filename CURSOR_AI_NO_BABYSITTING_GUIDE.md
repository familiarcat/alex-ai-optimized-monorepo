# 🚀 Cursor AI "No Babysitting" Guide

## 🎯 **The Simple Answer**

**YES!** There IS a way to stop babysitting Cursor AI prompts. It's called **"YOLO Mode"** and it's built right into Cursor AI.

## 🔧 **How to Enable "No Babysitting" Mode**

### Step 1: Open Cursor AI Settings
1. Open Cursor AI
2. Go to **Settings** (usually in the menu or with `Cmd+,` on Mac)
3. Look for **"Features"** or **"Chat & Composer"**

### Step 2: Enable YOLO Mode

## ⚡ **What YOLO Mode Does**

**Before YOLO Mode:**
- Cursor AI: "Should I create this file?" → You: "Yes" → File created
- Cursor AI: "Should I run this command?" → You: "Yes" → Command runs
