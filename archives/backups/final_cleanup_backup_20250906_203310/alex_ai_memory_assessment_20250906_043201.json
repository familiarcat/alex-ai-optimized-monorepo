ALWAYS use simple echo commands:\n   - Each echo command on its own line\n   - No complex strings or multi-line echo commands\n   - No quotes that span multiple lines\n   - Simple, self-contained commands\n\n2.

ALWAYS follow this pattern:\necho \"Simple text\"\necho \"More simple text\"\necho \"\"\necho \"Status: Working\"\necho \"Complete\"\n\n4.
