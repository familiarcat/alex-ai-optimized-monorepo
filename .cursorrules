# Cursor AI Rules for YOLO Mode Integration
# ========================================

## YOLO Mode Configuration
- YOLO Mode is enabled for terminal commands
- File operations still require confirmation (by design)
- Use keyboard shortcuts (⌘⮐) for faster confirmation

## Command Execution
- Terminal commands: Execute automatically with YOLO Mode
- File operations: Require confirmation (use ⌘⮐)
- Code generation: Require confirmation (use ⌘⮐)
- Script execution: Require confirmation (use ⌘⮐)

## Best Practices
- Batch related operations together
- Use terminal commands for system operations
- Accept file operation confirmations quickly
- Configure allowlist for common commands
- Keep denylist updated for safety

## Workflow Optimization
- Use YOLO Mode for: git, npm, python, system commands
- Use keyboard shortcuts for: file creation, code editing, script execution
- Combine both approaches for maximum efficiency

## Safety Considerations
- YOLO Mode cannot eliminate all confirmations (by design)
- File operations require confirmation to prevent data loss
- Use allowlist/denylist for command safety
- Always review changes before accepting
