        </div>

        <div class="crew-member">
            <div class="crew-name">üë®‚Äç‚úàÔ∏è Captain Jean-Luc Picard - Strategic Leadership</div>
            <div class="narrative">Captain Picard stands at the head of the conference table, his presence commanding respect and attention.</div>
            <div class="quote">"Engage. Welcome, everyone. We have achieved a significant milestone with our RAG system integration, but now we must consider the broader implications. The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, and our N8N workflow expansion could serve the many through enhanced automation and intelligence."</div>
            <div class="narrative">He pauses, looking around the room with his characteristic diplomatic wisdom.</div>
            <div class="quote">"I believe our RAG integration opens three critical strategic opportunities: First, we can create intelligent workflow orchestration where each crew member's expertise guides automated decision-making. Second, we can implement predictive analytics that anticipate user needs before they're expressed. Third, we can establish a self-improving system that learns from every interaction and optimizes itself continuously."</div>
            <div class="narrative">He gestures thoughtfully.</div>
            <div class="quote">"The question is not whether we should expand, but how we can do so responsibly while maintaining our core mission of serving our users. Make it so."</div>
        </div>

        <div class="crew-member">
            <div class="crew-name">‚öîÔ∏è Commander William Riker - Tactical Execution</div>
            <div class="narrative">Riker leans forward, his tactical mind already analyzing the operational implications.</div>
            <div class="quote">"Aye, Captain. Tactical analysis complete. From an execution standpoint, our RAG integration gives us unprecedented operational capabilities. Let's make it happen with precision and efficiency."</div>
            <div class="narrative">He gestures to the tactical display.</div>
            <div class="quote">"Here's what I see: We can create <strong>intelligent workflow chains</strong> where each crew member's RAG capabilities trigger the next appropriate workflow automatically. For example, if Data identifies a data pattern that requires security analysis, Worf's workflow activates automatically. If Geordi detects a technical issue, Crusher's health monitoring kicks in."</div>
            <div class="narrative">His eyes gleam with tactical enthusiasm.</div>
            <div class="quote">"We can also implement <strong>dynamic workflow routing</strong> where the system intelligently selects which crew member's expertise is most relevant for each incoming request. This would dramatically increase our response efficiency and accuracy."</div>
            <div class="narrative">He looks around the table.</div>
            <div class="quote">"From a tactical perspective, this isn't just an expansion - it's a complete transformation of how we operate. We're moving from reactive workflows to proactive, intelligent automation."</div>
        </div>

        <div class="crew-member">
            <div class="crew-name">ü§ñ Commander Data - Analytics & Logic</div>
            <div class="narrative">Data sits with perfect posture, his analytical mind processing the implications with mathematical precision.</div>

            <div class="narrative">His eyes seem to focus on some internal calculation.</div>
            <div class="quote">"From an analytical perspective, we can implement <strong>predictive workflow orchestration</strong>. By analyzing patterns in our RAG queries and responses, I can predict which workflows will be needed before they're requested. This would reduce latency by 73% and increase user satisfaction by 89%."</div>
            <div class="narrative">He tilts his head slightly.</div>
            <div class="quote">"Additionally, we can create <strong>cross-crew knowledge synthesis</strong>. When multiple crew members' RAG systems identify related patterns, we can automatically generate comprehensive solutions that combine all relevant expertise areas. This would create solutions that no single crew member could achieve alone."</div>
            <div class="narrative">His analytical mind continues processing.</div>
            <div class="quote">"The most intriguing possibility is <strong>recursive workflow improvement</strong>. Each RAG interaction generates data that can be used to optimize the workflows themselves, creating a self-improving system that becomes more effective over time."</div>

            <div class="narrative">His technical mind races with possibilities.</div>
            <div class="quote">"We can also implement <strong>distributed RAG processing</strong> where complex queries are automatically broken down and processed across multiple crew members simultaneously, then synthesized into a comprehensive response. This would handle much more complex requests than any single crew member could manage."</div>
            <div class="narrative">He looks excitedly around the room.</div>
            <div class="quote">"The most exciting possibility is <strong>workflow evolution</strong>. Our RAG system can learn from successful workflow patterns and automatically suggest new workflow combinations that we haven't even thought of yet!"</div>
        </div>
