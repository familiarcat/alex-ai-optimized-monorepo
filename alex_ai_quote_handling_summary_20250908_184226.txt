ðŸ§  ALEX AI MEMORY: Quote Handling System Fix
============================================

CRITICAL INSIGHT: Shell Quote Handling Safety

PROBLEM: dquote> and cmdand dquote> errors in shell commands
SOLUTION: safe-milestone-push.sh script with proper quote escaping
PRIORITY: CRITICAL - Prevents development workflow breakage

KEY POINTS:
- Always use safe-milestone-push.sh for milestone commits
- Use pnpm run milestone:safe for safe milestone pushes
- Never use complex quotes directly in shell commands
- Use printf for complex strings to avoid shell interpretation

PREVENTION: This memory must be referenced when creating any shell scripts
or git commands to prevent quote handling errors.

CREW RELEVANCE:
- Data: High (system operations)
- Geordi: High (technical infrastructure)
- Q: High (system anomalies)
- Others: Medium/Low (various specializations)
